// Summary Comment - Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

// Most modern programming languages start counting at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
