// Summary Comment - The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]).
// If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, use bracket notation.
//
// Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

// Setup
var testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

// Only change code below this line

var entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];   // Change this line
var drinkValue = testObj["the drink"];    // Change this line
